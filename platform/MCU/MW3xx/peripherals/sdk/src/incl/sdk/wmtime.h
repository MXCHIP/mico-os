 *  \brief Time Management Subsystem
 *
 * This module provides the time management APIs. Internally wireless
 * microcontroller manages time in terms of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970
 * 00:00). This representation is known as "posix time". These routines can
 * be used to do conversions between human readable time and posix time as well
 * as to set the system time to desired value.

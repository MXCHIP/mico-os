 *  \brief Slab/Block Allocator

 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * There are some packages which perform a large number of fixed-size
 * allocations. But, the maximum number of allocations that are active at any
 * given point in time is very less.
 * It would be desirable to have a slab allocator which can reduce the
 * fragmentation that may potentially be caused by the use of
 * such large number of allocations.
 * The slab/block allocator aims at allocating fixed size blocks as per the
 * requirement of the user, subject to the total size specified by the user
 * when initializing the pool of that specific block size.
 *
 * Example: If a user wishes to create a pool with restricted access and
 * having 10 blocks of size say 20 bytes, then he can first initialize the pool.
 *
 * For that he can use:
 *
 * * struct pool_info *pool_ptr;
 *
 * * char buffer[20 * 10];
 *
 * * char *block_ptr;
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * * Initialize Pool:
 * pool_ptr = ba_pool_create(20, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
 *
 * Further, he may allocate or deallocate blocks using the pool pointer.
 *
 * * Allocation
 * block_ptr = ba_block_allocate(pool_ptr);
 *
 * * Deallocation:
 * ba_block_release(pool_ptr, block_ptr);
 *
 * Further, if a user wishes to delete the memory pool, he may do so by:
 *
 * * Delete pool
 * ba_pool_delete(pool_ptr);
 *
 * \note A pool can be deleted only if all the blocks in it are free.
